# Zoro

In the current world of projects with increasing complexity of scaling, the only solution is to make it more complicated with adding in a cache, a db, and an entire orchestrator for all of the stack that's being used. Project Zoro is aimed to cut the slack and build systems following the actor model and achieve a great deal of user centric applicaitons with the ease of managing the same.
